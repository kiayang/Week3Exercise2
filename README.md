**EXERCISE: Second Custom Tag Lib**
Using the hello custom tag created above as an example, along with the tag lib resources in the syllabus, create a custom tag that displays a different welcome message based on the time of day: "Good morning!", "Good afternoon!", etc. Then, get a little fancier: if the date is 2/2, for example, include a "Groundhog Day" message.

Optional Extra Challenge
Think about functionality you might repeat on your JSPs that makes a good tag or set of tags. Add creation of those tags as a task to your individual project plan and implement them according to your schedule.
